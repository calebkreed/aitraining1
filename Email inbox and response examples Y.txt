Hi Josh,

It looks like this account is still pending install. We are unable to add additional funds to a buyout card until their paperwork is uploaded and the original $1000 is approved.

Can you provide a copy of this customer's contract or final invoice so we can assist?

Good afternoon,

Attached below is my early termination buyout document 

Outbound Response:

Hey Harkaran,

Thanks for sending this over to us. Unfortunately, we wouldn't be able to accept this as their final invoice. This appears to have been done in a Word document and these are almost always in a PDF when from an official source. Based on the invoice, they owe the entire 36 months for their ADT agreement, which doesn't logically work since they would've had to pay at least the 1st month immediately.

Would you be able to try and get their ADT agreement or an official invoice we can look at?

Hello, 


I forgot to add a buyout for my customer Lamont Combs (A-16918812). Please add a $1,000 buyout gift card for this customer without raising RMR at all. I approve whatever deduction it comes with if there is one. I would also like to approve an additional $391.78 on the buyout under my name because their buyout is a little over $1,000. 

Outbound Response:

Hi Angel,

We've created the $1000 card for this account. In order for us to increase the amount on the card, we will need their final invoice or contract from the previous company. If you have their paperwork, can you send that to us so we can adjust this further?

The deduction for this buyout will be $20 off the payable RMR + $150 as a flat fee. You will also be deducted for any amount over $1000 once we have their paperwork.

Hey I have attached picture of the Coustmers contract above can we please calculate it and send it to the costumer.

Outbound Response:

Dear Amolik,

Thank you for contacting us regarding the buyout process. After a thorough review of the customers account, I have identified a missing subscription, which currently prevents us from initiating the buyout process. Rest assured that we are committed to resolving this issue promptly, and I will closely monitor the customers account to ensure that the necessary documentation is promptly attached to enable us to proceed with the buyout.

Please let us know if you have any further questions or concerns. We appreciate the work you do and look forward to resolving this matter for you.

I apologize for that mistake, we will make sure the customers missing subscription get updated as soon as possible. I will keep you updated as the situation progresses.

Best regards,
Caleb Reed

I failed to add in her amp buyout what whatdo we need to do to fix it it? She’s getting installed tomorrow. My apologies it wont happen again. 1st deal in market i guess i got too excited… 

Outbound Response:

Hey Megz,

We are happy to assist with creating a buyout. We are not able to create the buyout until the customer is installed. Once they are installed, we will be able to further assist.

Also, because the base RMR was discounted to $35.99 you would see an automatic $10 PRMR and a $50 flat deduction to create the buyout. We will need these deductions to be authorized by you in order to create the buyout. 

Thank you,

Hello, my customer received the gift card form you guys.  we need to get the amount readjusted it's a lot less than what the contract is stating. Here is the contract attached. The gift card is only for $134 and it's supposed to be $800 and some change for the gift card amount. 

Outbound Response:

Hey Alyson!

We were able to get the gift card increased to: $517.39

The customer can expect to receive the additional funds in 24 to 48 hours. 

Looking through the contract they were installed with ADT on 3/31/2021 and installed with Vivint on 1/27/2023. This left them with 15 months remaining at a rate of $45.99. 15 months multiplied by the $45.99 adds up to $689.85, but their ADT contract states in 2. Early Termination of This Contract the customer only needs to pay 75% of the remaining monthly services. That is why we only increased the amount to $517.39

Let us know if you have any questions. 

Thank You,

Customer: Vernell Price

Hello! Mrs. Price found out that she did have a contract left with ADT. We were both unaware of this. Can you send her the buyout link to submit her contract to? Thank you!! 

Outbound Response:

Hi Ian,

We would be more than happy to get that set up for them. However if we were to set up this buyout you would see a deduction. That deduction would be a $20 PRMR and a $150 flat. Can you confirm that you're ok with that before we set up the buyout?

Thank you,
Caleb Reed​

Hey guys this is a buyout through CPI. They are switching to Vivint. Can you let me know the total buyout amount?

Outbound Response:

Hi Marqeese,

I hope this email finds you well. Upon conduction an audit of the paperwork provided, I was able to determine that the total amount for the buyout would come up to $1,799.64. As per the buyout rules, I would like to inform you that we are able to cover up to $1,000 of that amount.

However if you wish to authorize a deduction to cover more of the buyout, please do not hesitate to let us know. We would be more than happy to discuss further and find a solution for you and the customer.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. Please let me know if you have any further questions of concerns.

My name is Rion Lockwood 213902. I'd like to apply a buyout to this account. But raise the monitoring to $60. 

Is that possible?

Outbound Response:

Hi Rion,

Thank you for emailing in today! We would be more than happy to get a buyout setup for you, however I would recommend that we wait until the monitoring is raised to $60. Once that happens your deduction will be much more comfortable.

@SOS could you assist Rion in raising this customers RMR to $60? 

Once it is raised please email back in Rion and we will be more than happy to help you set up that buyout.

Thank You,
Caleb Reed​
